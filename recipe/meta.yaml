  summary: Tools for creating and unpacking squashfs filesystems

  description: |
    Squashfs is a highly compressed read-only filesystem for Linux.
    It uses either gzip/xz/lzo/lz4 compression to compress both files, inodes
    and directories.  Inodes in the system are very small and all blocks are
    packed to minimise data overhead. Block sizes greater than 4K are supported
    up to a maximum of 1Mbytes (default block size 128K).
